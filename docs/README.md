# Smart Grid Simulator

The Smart Grid Simulator is a virtual power station network designed to emulate real-world power generation and distribution. It allows testing and monitoring of smart grid systems without relying on physical hardware.

## Key Features
- Simulated Power Stations: Generate realistic power output based on configurable parameters.
- Real-Time Data Publishing: Station metadata, output, and status are continuously published via MQTT.
- Configurable & Extensible: Easily set up multiple stations using environment variables or configuration files.
- Monitoring Ready: Data can be visualized through dashboards or consumed by other applications.

## Use Cases
- Test smart grid applications safely and efficiently.
- Prototype dashboards and analytics for power monitoring.
- Simulate renewable and conventional energy sources.
